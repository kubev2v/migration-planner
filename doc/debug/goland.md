### Create configuration for local debugging

1. Add a new **Go Build** configuration.
2. Give it a name
3. For the API, Change the package path to: "`github.com/kubev2v/migration-planner/cmd/planner-api`"  
For the Agent, Change the package path to: "`github.com/kubev2v/migration-planner/cmd/planner-agent`"
4. Only for the API add "`run`" as Program Argument 
5. Click apply

### Create configuration for remote debugging

1. Add a new **Go Remote** configuration.
2. Give it a name
3. For the API, change the host to "localhost" and port to **40000**   
For the Agent, change the host to VM IP and port to **40001**
4. Click apply

## Step 4: Start Debugging Session

Click **Debug** on the remote configuration. GoLand will connect to the remote `dlv` server.
